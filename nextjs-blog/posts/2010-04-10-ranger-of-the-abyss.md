The kingdom of Britainnia and Ter-Mur had made an agreement relating to built a outpost in Abyss in order to keep close watch over the chaos in that dungeon.

That is why they need a number of candidates to help them. The finnal reward might be a unique hourse in Abyss.

This is a quest chain. Firstly, head to Britian Castle and talk to [Dexter the Royal Mage][].

So, you are one of the candidates for the position Ranger of the Abyss? Very good, I will help you prepare.

For [Dawn's][] campaign you will need [a lamp of spirituality][]. A lamp of spirituality detects extreme levels of good and evil. In this case we are using it to detect evil… and err, good.

Anyway, it doesn’t detect the garden variety evil that one might normally find in Britannia or it would just be changing color all the time and not be very useful. It detects infernal evil, as in arch-demon levels of evil. You are going to be using its power to detect the influence of the [Slasher of Veils][]! When you are in the [Stygian Abyss][], you will see that its light turns from white to purple, this is due to vice corruption.

I will make one of these lamps for you but you will need to gather the ingredients. The ingredients are both common and rare, but I assume that you are prepared for adventure? The ingredients are… are you writing this down? The ingredients are:

* a [lantern][]
* a [silver sapling seed][]
* a [rare serpent egg][]
* a [dark wisp orb][]

> I hear the rare serpent egg can be found near the lair of Medusa in the Abyss… very dangerous, better you than me… err, no offense intended. The wisp orb is an item that is usually protected by dark wisps. I understand that there are some in Ilshenar, if you see some wisps look around for a treasure chest, a wisp orb will be inside… it’s weird, I know. Hmm… I wonder how they open the chest? Anyway, I’m pretty sure you are going to have to kill the wisps to break the spell on the chest.

Now we should search for those items.

a lanten can be purchased from any Provisioner.

Silver Sapling Seed can be found in Abyss in a lovely garden.

Searching for a Rare Serpent Egg is a bit dangerous. You must get into a mass of snake. If you are lucky enough, a rare serpent egg might be found in a serpent nests near by Medusas’ Lair .

A dark wisp orb can be obtained in a chest named “Dark Wisp Treasure” in 2ed floor of wisp dungeon. Before you get it, you have to slay two Dark Wisp Guardian.

Now, looks like we have collected all of 4 items. Head to the royal mage, you will get the lamp of spirituality which looks like this –

It is time to talk to Sir Geoffrey the Captain of theRoyal Guard inside the Britain Castle, however do not forget to carry the lamp.

> Hail citizen! I see you have a lamp of spirituality. I now have an important mission for you on behalf of our queen, Dawn.
> 
> It is her majesty’s desire to have an outpost within the Stygian Abyss; however, it is currently impossible due to the strong vice influence of the Slasher of Veils. Unfortunately, killing him is not the simple answer and we must fight his influence by other means. I would ask you to aid in this campaign; your service will place you in the queen’s favor and will be rewarded.
> 
> Now, this is news to me but I am told there are locations in Sosaria called virtue nodes; it seems these locations radiate virtue. Dexter says that there are more of them in Trammel than Felucca, but they are fairly common and they clean the vice from our world. He believes that we will be able to use lamps of spirituality to discover virtue nodes in the Stygian Abyss and then use them to push back the influence of the Slasher of Veils enough to build an outpost.
> 
> Use your lantern of spirituality to seek out these virtue nodes, your lamp will glow green when you find one. Bury this virtue crystal at the spot and it will grow and amplify the node, which will cause additional nodes to be revealed (it will take one real day for a new node to be revealed). If we can discover and strengthen enough nodes, they will create a location that pure enough that we can build an outpost…. Will you take this quest?

As the 2ed part of quest chain, we should bury the [Virtue Crystal][] which is just got from Sir Geoffrey in the specified location in Abyss.

Enter the dungeon Abyss. We can see that the lamp glow purple light. What we should do is find a spot at where the lamp glow green light instand of purple light then bury the Virtue Crystal at there.
