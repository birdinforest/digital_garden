After the last work was finished, Queen Zhah went back to her reaml.

As Queen Dawn announced, an alliance has been built between two racese.

Someone killed a pig on the way Queen Zhah walked though, another man shouted “Clear road, vip coming though!.”

That is why this guy grumbled at the death of that pool pig.
