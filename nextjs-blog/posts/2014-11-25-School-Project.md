##OpenGL Demo
This is a assignment for demonstration of 3D graphic knowledge. This is a group project, I coorporate with another class mate, Kitman Yiu. This demo is based on OpenGL. We also used 3rd part framework from school(AIE framework), which provide basic 3d model import and camera transform API.

In this demo, we created a 3d environment and several animationed 3d characters. The environment contains a terrene created by tessellation, sky box, and a snow box based on GPU particle. We also created some custmoised shaders, like GPUParticle shader, Post Process shader, Shadow Map shader. There are dynimic lighting and several lighing effects, including bloom, ligh scatting and DOF.

##AI Demo(Behaviour Tree)
This is a individual assignment. In a 3D environment, a green colour character trys to run throgh the map from one side to another side. There are some walls on map. A red colour character is patroling on middle of map. If green colour character move too close to red character, red one starts chase green one. Both of them will speed up running until they use out stamina.

The AI is build by behaviour tree. In this project, I learned how to rig a 3d mode and record animation clips by Blender.
