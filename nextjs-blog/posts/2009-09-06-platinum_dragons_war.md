We finally got to the battlefield – outside of the Dungeon Wrong. Fierce battle was fought here, not just between platinum dragons and their crimson foes, but players supporting value and their enemies who are supporter of shadowlords.

Though incredibly, the crimson dragon won that battle. All of value supporters felt very miserable. They can not do anything but accepted this fact. The problem is if they can do  better in the next bettle in tomorrow.

Anyway, we got this pie as reward. What is this?  Mesanna’s Cream Pie? Or we can name it Mesanna’s Snow Ball, cause it can be throwed at others’ face. I think this maybe was a kind of secret weapon against crimson dragon and shadowlords. Let me have a try …

Do you see the pie is flying to EM? It will exploded at him and blow him to the other side of universe. LOL Wish it also works for shadowlords.

Fire in the hole！！
