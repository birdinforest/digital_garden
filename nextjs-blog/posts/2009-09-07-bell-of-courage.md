Although our allies, Platinum Dragons lost the battle yestoday, we finally discovered the portal to the lair of shadowlords with their intent of rebuilding a corrupted version of the Gem of Immortality, over witch they would rule. Tonight, we have chance to find and destroy the shadowlords and recover that corrupted gem.

Lady Dawn opened a moongate to daemon temple where, a portal was found at the top of the large staircase. All of us rushed through the portal, then we found ourseves were surrounded  by numerous manifestation of the shadowlords, blocking the way to the true ones.  We had to fight to gain ground.

Finally, all was still. The shadowlords were defeated. Lady Dawn removed the gem from pillar and gently slipped it into her pack.
